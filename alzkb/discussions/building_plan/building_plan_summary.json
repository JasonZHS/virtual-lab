  "summary_text": "### EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: AlzKB Construction Roadmap\n**Meeting Status:** ADJOURNED\n**Outcome:** APPROVED with Critical Amendments\n**Date:** October 26, 2023\n\nTeam, the planning phase for the Alzheimer\u2019s Knowledge Base is complete. Through rigorous Red Teaming, we have successfully pivoted away from a \"naive integration\" model to a **stratified, evidence-weighted architecture**. We have addressed critical risks regarding demographic bias in ADNI normalization and the danger of hallucinating therapeutic causality.\n\nWe are moving to **Execution Phase** immediately. Below are the **FINAL REVISED SPECIFICATIONS** that incorporate all corrections from the Scientific Critic and technical leads. These are now the law of the project.\n\n---\n\n### 1. FINAL SEMANTIC SCHEMA (Revised Phase A)\n*Status: Locked for Deployment*\n\n**A. The Haplotype-Aware Backbone**\nWe reject flat \"Patient-to-Gene\" links. The schema mandates explicit representation of Alleles and Zygosity to support precision queries.\n*   **Graph Pattern:**\n    `(:Patient {id: 'ADNI_123'})-[:HAS_GENOTYPE]->(:Genotype {zygosity: 'Heterozygous'})-[:COMPOSED_OF]->(:Allele {symbol: 'APOE e4'})-[:VARIANT_OF]->(:Gene {hgnc_id: 'HGNC:613'})`\n\n**B. The Logic Layer (Proven vs. Hypothesized)**\nTo prevent RAG hallucinations, we have split semantic inference into two disjoint branches:\n*   **Edge Type 1:** `cl:has_mechanism_of_action`\n    *   *Constraint:* STRICT. Source must be FDA Label or Phase III Clinical Trial.\n*   **Edge Type 2:** `alzkb:hypothesized_mechanism`\n    *   *Constraint:* INFERRED. Derived from pathway upstream/downstream logic.\n    *   *Metadata:* Must carry property `inference_confidence: 'LOW'`.\n\n**C. The \"Resilience\" Class Definition (Critic's Amendment)**\nWe define \"Resilience\" by hard metrics, not clinical labels.\n*   **OWL Class Definition:** `alzkb:Cognitive_Resilience`\n    *   **Intersection Of:**\n        1.  `has_amyloid_status value Positive`\n        2.  `has_tau_status value Positive`\n        3.  `has_cdr_global_score value 0.0`\n        4.  `has_mmse_score >= 29` (Corrected from generic \"Normal\" label)\n\n---\n\n### 2. FINAL DATA PIPELINE SPECS (Revised Phase B)\n*Status: In Development*\n\n**A. Stratified Normalization Protocol**\nGlobal Z-scoring is banned. Normalization occurs only within demographic buckets to preserve biological signal across diverse cohorts.\n*   **Logic:**\n    ```python\n    def get_norm_baseline(patient_row):\n        # Buckets defined by Red Team to prevent bias\n        bucket_key = {\n            'sex': patient_row['sex'],             # M/F\n            'age_dec': patient_row['age'] // 10,   # e.g., 70s, 80s\n            'apoe': patient_row['apoe_status']     # e.g., e3/e4\n        }\n        \n        # Check Reference Control Database\n        baseline = lookup_centroid(bucket_key)\n        \n        # Low-N Safety Valve\n        if baseline['n_controls'] < 30:\n            return None, \"RAW_UNHARMONIZED\"\n        else:\n            return (patient_row['val'] - baseline['mean']) / baseline['std'], \"NORMALIZED\"\n    ```\n\n**B. GWAS Ingestion Filter**\nPublication count filters are removed. We prioritize statistical power to capture novel discoveries.\n*   **Gate Logic:**\n    *   **ACCEPT IF:** `(p_value < 5e-8)` **AND** `(n_samples > 10,000)`\n    *   **REJECT IF:** Fails above criteria, regardless of journal impact factor.\n\n---\n\n### 3. VALIDATION & RETRIEVAL PROTOCOLS (Revised Phase C)\n*Status: Pending Data Load*\n\n**A. Resilience Benchmarking**\nWe have replaced expensive Centrality checks with Enrichment Analysis.\n*   **Test:** Fisher\u2019s Exact Test.\n*   **Hypothesis:** The list of genes connected to `Cognitive_Resilience` nodes must be significantly enriched for \"Longevity\" and \"Insulin Signaling\" pathways compared to the `Alzheimers_Dementia` subgraph.\n*   **Fail State:** $p > 0.05$ halts the pipeline.\n\n**B. RAG Intent Routing**\nThe Retrieval System acts as a gatekeeper based on query type.\n*   *Query:* \"How does drug X work?\" $\\rightarrow$ **Filter:** Exclude `hypothesized_mechanism`.\n*   *Query:* \"What implies drug X might work?\" $\\rightarrow$ **Filter:** Include `hypothesized_mechanism` with mandatory prefix: *\"Based on inferred pathway logic...\"*\n\n**C. Hallucination Mitigation**\n*   **Citation Token:** Every generated sentence must conclude with `[Src: {Source_ID}]`. Output without tokens is rejected by the post-processor.\n\n---\n\n### IMMEDIATE ACTION ITEMS\n1.  **Ontologist:** Commit the `.owl` file with the corrected `Cognitive_Resilience` definition by EOD.\n2.  **Data Engineer:** Deploy the `norm_biomarkers.py` script with the specific Age/Sex/APOE buckets defined above.\n3.  **Validation Scientist:** Write the Fisher's Exact Test script for the post-ingestion quality gate.\n\nWe are building the ground truth for Alzheimer's research. Let's make it count. **Execute.**",
