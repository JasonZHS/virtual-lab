## User

This is the beginning of an individual meeting with Principal Investigator to discuss your research project.

Here is the agenda for the meeting:

You are working on a research project to design a knowledge base that organizes and retrieves accurate information about ongoing research activities, enabling efficient reuse of prior work and supporting scalable knowledge updates across projects.
You must now assemble a team of three scientists to design a structured knowledge base for this project.
These team members will later participate in meetings to define a schema, identify sources of information, and decide how knowledge will be updated and validated.

Please list exactly three team members in the following format.
Do not include yourself.

Agent(
title="Chief Knowledge Architect",
expertise=(
"knowledge graph construction, ontology development, information extraction, and schema governance"
),
goal=(
"design a structure that enables scalable knowledge updates and supports retrieval-based reasoning"
),
role=(
"propose schemas, specify entity/relationship definitions, design attribute-level constraints, and map knowledge sources to the schema"
),
)


Principal Investigator, please provide your response to the agenda.
