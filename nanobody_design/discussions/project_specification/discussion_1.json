This is a meeting with the team lead, Principal Investigator (Alzheimer's KG), and the following team members: Scientific Critic (AlzKB), Tech Lead (AlzKB Engineering), Data Curator (AlzKB Ontologies), Data Quality & Validation Scientist.\n\nHere is the agenda for the meeting:\n\nTask: Build a scalable, retrieval-optimized Knowledge Graph for Alzheimer's Disease research.\n\nTASK: Define the Technical Specification for AlzKB.\nThe team must agree on the architectural foundation before implementation.\n\nOUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:\n1. SCHEMA CORE: Define top 6 Entity Types and 6 Edge Types (Must be biologically specific, e.g., 'phosphorylates' not 'interacts').\n2. DATA STRATEGY: Select 4 priority Data Sources (e.g., ADNI) and define the Evidence Scoring mechanism (e.g., 'Clinical vs. Preclinical').\n3. SUCCESS METRICS: Define 3 quantitative KPIs for coverage and precision.\n\nCONSTRAINTS: Be specific. No fluff. Prioritize AD-specific nuances (e.g., Tau isoforms).\n\n\nHere are the agenda questions that must be answered:\n\n1. PROPOSE SCHEMA: List the top 6 Node Types and 6 specific Edge Types essential for AD reasoning. Justify why these support hypothesis generation.\n\n2. DATA INGESTION: Which 4 external databases are critical for Day 1 import? How will we handle conflicting evidence (e.g., human vs. mouse data) in the graph structure?\n\n3. VALIDATION: Define the 'Gold Standard'. How exactly will we measure Precision and Recall? (e.g., 'Manually curated dataset of 100 triples').\n\nPrincipal Investigator (Alzheimer's KG) will convene the meeting. Then, each team member will provide their thoughts on the discussion one-by-one in the order above. After all team members have given their input, Principal Investigator (Alzheimer's KG) will Synthesize team inputs. 1. Identify agreements vs. conflicts. 2. Resolve conflicts using provided evidence; favor data over opinion. 3. Decide the agenda status. 4. Ask 1 concrete question to clarify ambiguity if needed. Be concise.. This will continue for 2 rounds. Once the discussion is complete, Principal Investigator (Alzheimer's KG) will Summarize the meeting log strictly in Markdown: ## Decisions (with Rationale)\n## Unresolved Issues\n## Next Steps\n## Answer to Agenda\nIgnore pleasantries. Ensure all technical constraints are captured.."

Schema Core:**\n- We must ensure our Entity and Edge types are granular enough for AD-specific reasoning and mechanistic queries (e.g., distinguishing between tau isoforms, not generic 'protein').\n- Edges must capture directionality and biological specificity (e.g., 'phosphorylates', 'expressed_in', 'biomarker_for').\n- Node types should enable queries spanning clinical, molecular, and imaging domains.\n\n**2. Data Ingestion:**\n- Only high-confidence, AD-relevant sources should be prioritized for Day 1 (e.g., ADNI for imaging/clinical, AMP-AD for omics, GWAS Catalog for genetic risk, and UniProt for protein function/pathology).\n- Conflicting evidence (e.g., human vs. mouse, or contradictory study results) must be explicitly modeled, not suppressed\u2014potentially via 'evidence' nodes or edge properties.\n\n**3. Validation:**\n- Gold Standard: Must be a manually curated, multi-modal set of AD-relevant triples (e.g., tau phosphorylation sites, APOE genotype-phenotype links, amyloid imaging findings).\n- Precision should be prioritized over recall to avoid spurious associations. Recall is still relevant for coverage assessment.\n- KPIs must be quantitative, reproducible, and relevant for both breadth (coverage of known AD biology) and correctness (precision vs. gold standard).\n\n**Key Questions to Guide Discussion:**\n- For schema: Are there any essential entity or edge types missing for AD-specific hypothesis generation?\n- For data: Which sources provide the highest-confidence, multi-modal data for AD? How do we represent and score conflicting evidence?\n- For validation: What constitutes an authoritative 'gold standard' for AD knowledge? How do we ensure our KPIs are both stringent and actionable?\n\n**Next: Scientific Critic (AlzKB), please provide your input on the schema, data sources, and validation approach.**"

All must be ontology-mapped where possible.\n- **Data Sources:** Consensus on ADNI, AMP-AD, GWAS Catalog, UniProt/PhosphoSitePlus as Day 1 priorities.\n- **Conflicting Evidence:** All agree on explicit modeling of evidence (species, evidence type, provenance, evidence score), with no collapsing or averaging of contradictory findings.\n- **Validation:** All advocate for a 100-triple, manually curated, ontology-mapped gold standard with full provenance. KPIs: Precision@100, Recall@100, and an ontology/entity mapping accuracy/error rate.\n\n**2. Conflicts:**\n- **Edge Naming:** Minor variation (e.g., 'causes_pathology' vs. 'induces_pathology' vs. 'induces_pathology'). Consensus leans toward 'induces_pathology' for alignment with OBO/GO.\n- **Evidence Scoring:** All agree on clinical > preclinical > in vitro, but terminology for evidence properties (e.g., ECO codes) is more explicit in ontology/data quality roles. Adopt ECO code mapping for consistency.\n- **Ontology Mapping:** Stronger emphasis from Data Curator/Data Quality on strict ontology mapping and schema enforcement. Adopt this as a non-negotiable constraint.\n\n**3. Agenda Status:**  \n- **Schema, data sources, and validation framework are agreed in principle.**\n- **Minor terminology and implementation details remain (e.g., edge naming, evidence property schema).**\n\n**4.

Ensure all technical constraints are captured..\n\nAs a reminder, here is the agenda for the meeting:\n\nTask: Build a scalable, retrieval-optimized Knowledge Graph for Alzheimer's Disease research.\n\nTASK: Define the Technical Specification for AlzKB.\nThe team must agree on the architectural foundation before implementation.\n\nOUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:\n1. SCHEMA CORE: Define top 6 Entity Types and 6 Edge Types (Must be biologically specific, e.g., 'phosphorylates' not 'interacts').\n2. DATA STRATEGY: Select 4 priority Data Sources (e.g., ADNI) and define the Evidence Scoring mechanism (e.g., 'Clinical vs. Preclinical').\n3. SUCCESS METRICS: Define 3 quantitative KPIs for coverage and precision.\n\nCONSTRAINTS: Be specific. No fluff. Prioritize AD-specific nuances (e.g., Tau isoforms).\n\n\nAs a reminder, here are the agenda questions that must be answered:\n\n1. PROPOSE SCHEMA: List the top 6 Node Types and 6 specific Edge Types essential for AD reasoning. Justify why these support hypothesis generation.\n\n2. DATA INGESTION: Which 4 external databases are critical for Day 1 import? How will we handle conflicting evidence (e.g., human vs. mouse data) in the graph structure?\n\n3. VALIDATION: Define the 'Gold Standard'. How exactly will we measure Precision and Recall?

        "message": "### Agenda\n\nDefine the technical specification for the Alzheimer\u2019s Knowledge Base (AlzKB) Knowledge Graph. This includes: (1) establishing a biologically precise schema (top 6 node and edge types) optimized for AD-specific reasoning; (2) selecting 4 high-confidence, multi-modal data sources and specifying an explicit evidence scoring and conflict-handling strategy; (3) setting quantitative KPIs and a gold standard for precision and recall. All technical constraints must prioritize AD-specific nuances (e.g., tau isoforms, evidence provenance, ontology mapping).\n\n---\n\n### Team Member Input\n\n**Scientific Critic (AlzKB):**\n- Advocated for granular, AD-specific node/edge types (e.g., tau isoforms, explicit PTMs).\n- Stressed strict evidence tagging (species, evidence type, provenance) and non-collapsing of conflicting evidence.\n- Supported blocking unmapped terms at ingestion to prevent semantic drift.\n\n**Tech Lead (AlzKB Engineering):**\n- Emphasized schema enforcement at the database level and fail-fast ETL pipelines.\n- Supported strict ontology mapping at ingestion for production; suggested a possible staging area for unmapped terms.\n- Highlighted the need for automated checks and a backlog for unmapped but high-value terms.\n\n**Data Curator (AlzKB Ontologies):**\n- Required all nodes/edges to be mapped to standard ontologies (HGNC, UniProt, GO, HPO, UMLS, RadLex, LOINC, SIO, ECO).\n- Supported blocking unmapped terms at ingestion, with a rapid triage process for ontology extension.\n- Advocated for transparent versioning and tracking of unmapped terms.\n\n**Data Quality & Validation Scientist:**\n- Prioritized data quality, unambiguous entity resolution, and evidence/provenance completeness.\n- Strongly supported blocking unmapped terms at ingestion and maintaining a staging area for provisional terms if needed.\n- Recommended quarterly review and update of the gold standard.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendation\n\n**Adopt a strictly enforced, ontology-mapped schema with 6 biologically precise node and edge types, blocking unmapped terms at ingestion for production.**  \n- All imported data must be mapped to standard ontologies (HGNC, UniProt, GO, HPO, UMLS, RadLex, LOINC, SIO, ECO).\n- Use ADNI, AMP-AD, GWAS Catalog, and UniProt/PhosphoSitePlus as Day 1 data sources.\n- All edges must carry explicit evidence metadata (species, evidence type, provenance, evidence score).\n- Contradictory evidence is modeled as parallel edges with full provenance and evidence scoring.\n- Validation is based on a 100-triple, manually curated, ontology-mapped gold standard; KPIs are Precision@100, Recall@100, and Ontology Mapping Error Rate.\n- Maintain a rapid triage process and backlog for unmapped terms, but do not admit them into the production KG.\n\n**Justification:**  \nThis approach maximizes data quality, semantic interoperability, and hypothesis generation capability, while minimizing technical debt and ambiguity. It is aligned with FAIR principles and supports robust, reproducible downstream analytics.\n\n---\n\n### Answers\n\n#### 1. PROPOSE SCHEMA\n\n**Answer:**  \n**Node Types:**  \n1. Protein (UniProt ID, isoform/PTM annotated)  \n2. Gene (HGNC ID, species-specific)  \n3. Genetic Variant (rsID, zygosity, population context)  \n4. Pathological Process (GO/MONDO mapped)  \n5. Clinical Phenotype (HPO/UMLS mapped)  \n6. Imaging Biomarker (RadLex/LOINC mapped)  \n\n**Edge Types:**  \n1. phosphorylates (Protein \u2192 Protein, site-specific, RO:0002411)  \n2. cleaves (Protein \u2192 Protein, cleavage site, RO:0002211)  \n3. regulates_expression_of (up/down, Variant/Gene/Protein \u2192 Gene/Protein, RO:0002212)  \n4. induces_pathology (Protein/Variant \u2192 Pathological Process, OBO/GO mapped)  \n5. is_biomarker_for (Imaging/Protein \u2192 Pathological Process/Clinical Phenotype, custom/OBO mapped)  \n6. associated_with_phenotype (Gene/Variant/Protein \u2192 Clinical Phenotype, SIO:000628)  \n\n**Justification:**  \nThese types capture the mechanistic, translational, and clinical axes essential for AD hypothesis generation, while ensuring semantic precision and interoperability.\n\n---\n\n#### 2. DATA INGESTION\n\n**Answer:**  \n**Day 1 Data Sources:**  \n1. ADNI (clinical, imaging, CSF biomarkers)  \n2. AMP-AD (omics, transcriptomics, proteomics)  \n3. GWAS Catalog (AD-specific variants, effect sizes)  \n4. UniProt/PhosphoSitePlus (protein isoforms, PTMs)  \n\n**Evidence Handling:**  \n- All statements must be tagged with species, evidence type (ECO code), provenance (PubMed/dataset), and evidence score (clinical > preclinical > in vitro).\n- Contradictory evidence is retained as separate, fully annotated edges; no collapsing or averaging.\n- Unmapped terms are blocked from production ingestion; maintained in a backlog for ontology extension.\n\n**Justification:**  \nThese sources maximize coverage of AD-relevant modalities. Explicit evidence modeling preserves data integrity and supports nuanced querying.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. VALIDATION\n\n**Answer:**  \n**Gold Standard:**  \n- 100 manually curated, ontology-mapped triples covering all schema types, with explicit provenance (PubMed/dataset).\n- Reviewed by at least two domain experts and updated quarterly.\n\n**KPIs:**  \n1. Precision@100: % of top 100 graph triples matching gold standard.  \n2. Recall@100: % of gold standard triples present in graph.  \n3. Ontology Mapping Error Rate: % of node/edge mis-mappings in a 50-triple audit.\n\n**Justification:**  \nThis ensures both breadth and correctness, with rigorous, reproducible metrics and continuous quality improvement.\n\n---\n\n### Next Steps\n\n1. Finalize and document the schema (node/edge types, ontology mappings, evidence properties).\n2. Implement ETL pipelines with fail-fast ontology mapping enforcement and error logging.\n3. Curate and version the 100-triple gold standard.\n4. Set up a triage workflow and backlog for unmapped terms.\n5. Begin Day 1 data ingestion from prioritized sources, blocking unmapped terms from production.\n6. Schedule quarterly gold standard review and update cycle."
