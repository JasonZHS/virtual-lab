PROPOSE SCHEMA\n- **Priority:** The schema must directly support complex AD hypotheses, such as the relationship between specific tau isoforms, genetic risk (APOE alleles), and clinical phenotypes.  \n- **Node Types:** Entities must reflect AD pathophysiology and research granularity. Avoid generic terms; e.g., 'Tau Isoform', not just 'Protein'.\n- **Edge Types:** Specify mechanistic or causal relations, e.g., \u2018phosphorylates\u2019, \u2018expressed_in\u2019. Avoid vague edges like 'associated_with'.\n\n**Key Question:** Which node and edge types are non-negotiable for enabling queries about disease mechanism, biomarker progression, and translational interventions?\n\n---\n\n### 2. DATA INGESTION\n- **Core Datasets:** ADNI is essential for imaging/clinical; AMP-AD for multi-omic genetics. Prioritize datasets with standardized, high-quality evidence.\n- **Conflicting Evidence:** There must be a mechanism for evidence provenance and scoring: human > preclinical, but both must be queryable. Represent species as node/edge properties.\n\n**Key Question:** How will the graph structure encode evidence type, and what is the proposed hierarchy for conflicting findings (e.g., human clin > mouse model)?\n\n---\n\n### 3. VALIDATION\n- **Gold Standard:** Need a reference set of triples, ideally from expertly curated AD datasets/publications.\n- **Metrics:** Precision is paramount to avoid spurious links. Recall is secondary but must be tractable.\n\n**Key Question:** What curated resources exist for benchmarking, and how will we construct the manual validation set (e.g., 100 high-confidence triples covering all node/edge types)?\n\n---\n\n**Guidance to Team:**\n- Anchor all proposals in AD biology, not generic biomedicine.\n- Justify each choice with evidence or standard practice (e.g., ontologies, prior KGs).\n- Consider the end-user: neuroscientists must be able to trace hypotheses from genetics through pathology to phenotype.\n\n**Please address the above questions in your responses.**"

PROPOSE SCHEMA\n\n**Node Types (Entities):**\n1. **Protein Isoform** (e.g., MAPT Tau-441, APP695)  \n   - Must be mapped to UniProt isoform IDs and sequence variants for unambiguous reference.\n2. **Gene Variant** (e.g., rs429358 for APOE*\u03b54, rs75932628 for TREM2-R47H)  \n   - Use dbSNP, ClinVar, and HGVS nomenclature to ensure interoperability and variant normalization.\n3. **Brain Region (Anatomical Structure)**  \n   - Map to Uberon or Brain Region Ontology (BRO); needed for anatomical precision.\n4. **Cell Type**  \n   - Require mapping to Cell Ontology (CL) for standardization; distinguish between cell subtypes (e.g., reactive astrocyte vs. baseline).\n5. **Clinical Phenotype**  \n   - Use Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) or MONDO Disease Ontology; enable linkage to diagnostic criteria and subtypes (e.g., amnestic MCI, EOAD).\n6. **Biomarker Measurement**  \n   - Explicitly map to LOINC or SNOMED CT codes for standardized test names and analytes (e.g., CSF pTau181 LOINC: 96489-5).\n\n**Edge Types (Relations):**\n1. **phosphorylates** (RO:0002419)  \n   - Use Relation Ontology for precise semantics; critical for detailing post-translational modifications.\n2. **expressed_in** (RO:0002206)  \n   - Standard in OBO Foundry; ensures compatibility with existing cell/tissue atlases.\n3. **aggregates_to** (custom, must be mapped to GO or tailored extension)  \n   - Distinguish between amyloid plaque formation (GO:1902553) and tau fibrilization.\n4. **modulates_risk_of** (MONDO/RO:0003304, or custom if needed)  \n   - Differentiate direct pathogenic effect from risk association (e.g., GWAS odds ratio).\n5. **measured_in** (BFO:0000050 \"part of\", or create explicit measurement_of relation)  \n   - Link measurement entity to clinical or anatomical context.\n6. **infiltrates** (RO:0002430, \"migrates to\")  \n   - Align with immune/cell migration ontologies for cross-dataset harmonization.\n\n**Justification:**  \nStandard vocabularies are essential for data harmonization, entity/entity normalization, and future integration with external KGs. Each entity and relation should be annotated with CURIE/IRI for traceability, synonym resolution, and synonym mapping (e.g., \"pTau181\" = \"phosphorylated tau at threonine 181\").\n\n---\n\n### 2. DATA INGESTION\n\n**Priority Data Sources:**\n1. **ADNI** (clinical, imaging, and fluid biomarkers)  \n   - Use established LOINC/SNOMED CT for biomarker data.\n2. **AMP-AD Knowledge Portal** (multi-omic, transcriptomic, network analyses)  \n   - Harmonize gene/protein IDs with Ensembl/UniProt.\n3. **ROSMAP** (deep phenotyping, robust postmortem data)  \n   - Map brain region/cell type data to Uberon/CL.\n4. **UniProt (isoforms, PTMs, functional annotation)**  \n   - Standard reference for mapping protein-level data.\n\n**Handling Conflicting Evidence:**\n- **Provenance Encoding:**  \n  - Each triple/edge must be annotated with `source`, `species` (NCBI Taxon), `evidence type` (ECO: Evidence & Conclusion Ontology), and `confidence score`.\n- **Scoring Mechanism:**  \n  - Use a layered evidence score:  \n    - Clinical (human diagnosis, LOINC-encoded biomarker): Score 3  \n    - Human postmortem (ROSMAP): Score 2  \n    - Animal model (species-specific, e.g., NCBITaxon:10090 for mouse): Score 1  \n  - Retain all edges with provenance, but allow filtering by evidence class.\n\n---\n\n### 3. VALIDATION\n\n**Gold Standard:**  \n- **Source:** Manually curated set of 100 triples, stratified by node and edge type. Use recent, high-impact AD reviews (e.g., AlzForum, systematic reviews with explicit evidence tables).\n- **Manual Curation:** Each triple should be verified by at least two domain/ontology experts, documented with literature DOIs or dataset accessions.\n\n**Metrics:**  \n- **Precision:** Correct triples (as per gold standard) / Total triples sampled.\n- **Recall:** Gold standard triples present in KG / Total gold standard triples.\n- **Ontology Coverage:** % of entities/relations mapped to standard vocabularies (target >90%).\n\n**Additional Notes:**  \n- Ontology-driven validation scripts will check for compliance (e.g., no dangling nodes, all relations conform to domain/range restrictions as per reference ontologies).\n- Cross-modal synonym harmonization is required before loading any data.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**  \n- Agree with Technical Lead on entity and relation scope, but stress that every schema element must be fully normalized to reference ontologies and codes.  \n- All evidence must be explicitly scored and provenance-annotated\u2014this is essential for filtering and downstream analytics.  \n- Validation must include both precision/recall and ontology mapping coverage.  \n- No instances of custom, ambiguous entity names/relations allowed."

PROPOSE SCHEMA\n\n**Node Types (Entities):**\nFully aligned with prior proposals, but from an extraction/validation perspective, the following are critical for high-precision NLP and automated curation:\n\n1. **Protein Isoform** (curated to isoform-level, e.g., \u201cTau-441\u201d, with UniProt IDs)  \n   - Key: Disambiguate between general \u201cMAPT\u201d and isoform-specific effects; necessary to avoid merging experimental findings.\n2. **Gene Variant** (normalized to dbSNP/ClinVar, HGVS syntax enforced)  \n   - For machine reading, require regex validation and ID normalization for all extracted variants.\n3. **Brain Region** (standardized to Uberon/Allen Brain Atlas)  \n   - High-resolution labels reduce ambiguity in region-specific findings.\n4. **Cell Type** (Cell Ontology ID, subtype support)  \n   - Extraction pipeline must resolve ambiguous mentions (e.g., \u201cactivated microglia\u201d).\n5. **Clinical Phenotype** (HPO/MONDO, precise mapping mandatory)  \n   - Avoid \u201ccatch-all\u201d clinical labels\u2014subtype precision improves downstream validation.\n6. **Biomarker Measurement** (LOINC/SNOMED, with units and thresholds)  \n   - Extraction engine should enforce normalization to codes and support value/range parsing.\n\n**Edge Types (Relations):**  \nI concur with prior proposals but emphasize the following for extraction/validation feasibility:\n\n1. **phosphorylates**  \n   - Extraction must discriminate directionality and site (e.g., \u201cpTau181\u201d vs. \u201cpTau217\u201d).\n2. **expressed_in**  \n   - Pipeline should distinguish between spatial vs. cell-type context, sometimes co-mentioned.\n3. **aggregates_to**  \n   - Need to resolve various forms: \u201coligomerizes\u201d, \u201cforms tangles\u201d\u2014all mapped to canonical relation.\n4. **modulates_risk_of**  \n   - Enforce explicit evidence; extraction models often overstate causality. Must downweight \u201cassociated_with\u201d unless supported by effect size or odds ratio.\n5. **measured_in**  \n   - Extraction must link specific analyte, sample type, and patient population for downstream QA.\n6. **infiltrates**  \n   - Validate with context (e.g., cell migration in AD tissue, not immune cell infiltration elsewhere).\n\n**Justification:**  \nExtraction/validation pipelines must be schema-driven; ambiguous mentions or generic relations are a major source of false positives. All extraction rules/models will be benchmarked against these schema constraints.\n\n---\n\n### 2. DATA INGESTION\n\n**Priority Datasets:**  \nAgree with ADNI, AMP-AD, ROSMAP, UniProt (with isoform/PTM focus). For extraction QA, propose *AlzForum Mutations Database* as a supplementary benchmark for prioritizing genotype-phenotype assertions.\n\n**Handling Conflicting Evidence:**  \n- **Edge Annotation:** For every extracted triple, store:  \n  - Source (dataset/pubmed ID)\n  - Species (NCBI Taxon)\n  - Evidence Type (ECO code)\n  - Extraction Confidence (model score, evidence tier as outlined above)\n- **Conflict Protocol:** All conflicting edges are retained with evidence meta-data.

VALIDATION\n\n**Gold Standard Design:**\n- 100 manually curated triples, balanced across node/edge types.\n- Source: Recent systematic AD reviews, AlzForum, and high-confidence datasets.\n- Each triple annotated with evidence code, source DOI, mapping to ontology IDs.\n- QA: All extracted triples from Day 1 pipeline are compared to gold standard; further error analysis on false positives to refine extraction rules.\n\n**Metrics:**\n- **Precision:** #TP/(#TP + #FP); target > 90%.\n- **Recall:** #TP/(#TP + #FN); target > 60% initially.\n- **False Positive Analysis:** % of spurious/unsupported edges after manual review; target <5%.\n- **Ontology Coverage:** % of extracted entities/relations correctly mapped to reference ontologies; target >90%.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- Schema and ingestion plan are extraction- and QA-ready.\n- No ambiguous/generic nodes or relations admitted.\n- All validation protocols must be automated and manual, with rigorous error analysis and evidence-based scoring.\n- Disagree with use of any custom relations/entities not mappable to standards.  \n- Strongly support scoring and retention of all evidence but mandate hard filtering of unsupported or hallucinated links before deployment."

PROPOSE SCHEMA\n\n**Strengths Noted:**\n- All team members have converged on AD-specific, granular entity types (Protein Isoform, Gene Variant with proper normalization, etc.) and have rejected generic categories.\n- Edge types proposed are mechanistic and biologically actionable, avoiding vague relations.\n\n**Critical Review:**\n- **Enforce Predicate Specificity:**  \n  - Any admission of \u2018modulates_risk_of\u2019 must be tightly operationalized. It should only be used when a variant shows statistically significant effect size in human cohorts, not merely when reported in animal/preclinical studies.\n  - 'Aggregates_to' must distinguish between different aggregate morphologies: e.g., prefibrillar oligomers vs. mature fibrils vs. plaques. If not, downstream analyses may yield misleading hypotheses.\n- **Node Type Resolution:**  \n  - Protein Isoforms: Explicitly require distinction between post-translational modification states (e.g., pTau181 vs. unmodified Tau-441), not just sequence variants.\n  - Gene Variants: Do not allow 'Gene' or 'SNP' as catch-all nodes; enforce extraction/curation at the variant and allele level (e.g., rsID + allele).\n  - Clinical Phenotype: Must not conflate 'dementia' with 'Alzheimer\u2019s disease'; require all phenotype assignments to be grounded in diagnostic criteria (DSM, NINCDS-ADRDA, etc.).\n- **Ontology Compliance:**  \n  - Insist on mapping all schema elements to formal ontologies and providing CURIEs/IRIs at load time. Any custom relations must be explicitly justified, mapped, or rejected.\n\n---\n\n### 2. DATA INGESTION\n\n**Data Source Audit:**\n- The group\u2019s selection (ADNI, AMP-AD, ROSMAP, UniProt) is appropriate for Day 1, but:\n  - **Species Provenance:** All imported data (especially from AMP-AD and ROSMAP, which include mouse models) must be indexed by species; no merging of murine and human data in any edge/entity. Murine findings should be explicitly linked to the NCBI Taxon ID for mouse.\n  - **Preclinical/Clinical Split:** Evidence scoring must never mask the underlying species or study type\u2014downweighting is not enough. Allow users to exclude all non-human assertions at query time.\n  - **Data Versioning:** Provenance must include precise dataset version/date to ensure reproducibility.\n\n**Conflict Handling:**  \n- Conflicting findings (e.g., gene knockout in mouse vs. human GWAS) must be explicitly represented as separate edges, never merged or averaged.\n\n---\n\n### 3. VALIDATION\n\n**Gold Standard & Metrics Requirements:**\n- **Manual Curation:** Gold standard triples must cover all edge types AND all entity types, with at least 2 independent curators cross-reviewing each entry. \n- **Provenance Traceability:** Each gold standard triple must be linked to at least one PubMed ID or dataset accession; \u201creview article consensus\u201d is not sufficient without explicit reference extraction.\n- **Success Metrics:**  \n  - **Precision:** Only accept as \u201ccorrect\u201d those triples that can be traced to primary, peer-reviewed evidence (not database inferences alone).\n  - **Recall:** Quantify by edge type and entity type, not just overall, to surface systematic extraction/database biases.\n  - **F1 Score:** Demand reporting of F1 (harmonic mean of precision and recall) for the gold standard set.\n\n**Additional Requirements:**\n- **No Circular Evaluation:** The gold standard must not include any triples that were used to train/extract the KG; otherwise, precision/recall are inflated.\n- **Biological Plausibility Filter:** Any triple that fails basic biological plausibility (e.g., \u201cAstrocyte phosphorylates Tau\u201d) is automatically counted as a false positive, regardless of extraction confidence.\n\n---\n\n**Summary:**\n- Commend the schema and data source rigor.\n- Demand operational precision for each edge/entity to prevent downstream scientific misinterpretation.\n- Explicitly disallow conflation of AD with generic dementia, human with mouse data, or PTM states with parent isoforms.\n- Provenance and evidence scoring must be encoded at the triple level.\n- No metrics accepted unless evaluated on a properly blinded, gold-standard set covering all schema elements with quantitative results (Precision, Recall, F1)."

Key points:\n\n- **Distinct Nodes:**  \n  - Each biochemically and functionally distinct PTM (e.g., Tau-441 phosphorylated at T181) is a unique node, assigned a UniProt PTM identifier or custom IRI/annotation if no standard exists.\n  - Parent-child relationships (e.g., \u2018is_modified_form_of\u2019) can link modified/unmodified forms, enabling both granular and aggregate queries.\n\n- **Advantages:**  \n  - *Query power:* Enables precise graph traversal\u2014e.g., \"find all effects specific to pTau181, not just general Tau.\"\n  - *Data provenance:* Supports evidence tracking at the PTM-specific level.\n  - *Extensibility:* Allows future addition of other PTMs (acetylation, ubiquitination).\n  - *Alignment:* Fully compatible with property graph and RDF triple models, and with BioPAX/BEL best practices.\n\n- **Edge Modeling:**  \n  - Mechanistic edges (e.g., \u2018phosphorylates\u2019, \u2018aggregates_to\u2019) always operate on specific PTM nodes.\n  - \u2018is_modified_form_of\u2019 edges link PTM-specific nodes to the canonical isoform.\n\n- **Implementation Considerations:**  \n  - **ETL:** Extraction/ingestion pipelines must resolve mentions like \u201cpTau181\u201d to the corresponding PTM node, mapping via text mining + UniProt/PTM ontologies.\n  - **Ontology:** Use PSI-MOD identifiers for PTMs when possible, fallback to curated IRIs if not available.\n\n---\n\n### Concerns with Alternative Models:\n\n- **Node attributes only:**  \n  - Loses granularity\u2014cannot distinguish mechanistic links to specific PTMs vs. parent proteins.\n- **Reified triples with qualifiers:**  \n  - Adds significant complexity to property graph query patterns; not well supported in Neo4j-style queries.\n  - Typically reduces query performance and clarity for end-users.\n\n---\n\n### Summary:\n\n- All PTM states (e.g., pTau181, pTau217) are distinct nodes, fully ontology-mapped, and linked to canonical isoform nodes via \u2018is_modified_form_of\u2019 relations.\n- Extraction and ETL pipelines must be PTM-aware and enforce normalization at the node level.\n- This maximizes both biological rigor and technical scalability.\n\n---\n\n**No further disagreements.** I fully support the points raised by the Scientific Critic and Biomedical Ontologist regarding granularity, and the need for both schema-level and evidence-level precision."

The team must:\n- Establish a schema core with six biologically specific node and edge types.\n- Select four priority data sources and define an evidence/provenance scoring protocol.\n- Define three quantitative KPIs for measuring KG coverage, precision, and ontology/validation compliance.\n- All specifications must be AD-specific, ontology-driven, and enable fine-grained mechanistic hypothesis generation.\n\n---\n\n### Team Member Input\n\n**Technical Lead:**  \n- Advocated for distinct nodes for each PTM state (e.g., pTau181 as a separate node), parent-child relationships for isoforms/PTMs, and explicit provenance at the node/edge level.\n- Emphasized use of property-graph compatible models; ambiguous PTMs should be their own nodes, clearly labeled and excluded by default from analyses.\n\n**Biomedical Ontologist:**  \n- Stressed alignment with formal ontologies: PSI-MOD for PTMs, UniProt/dbSNP for proteins/variants, Uberon/CL for anatomy/cell type.\n- Required all schema elements and ambiguous PTMs to be ontology-mapped and tracked as unique nodes, with strict provenance and default analytic exclusion.\n\n**Data Science Lead:**  \n- Detailed extraction pipeline requirements: node-level resolution for PTMs/aggregates, extraction/QA of ambiguous PTMs as separate nodes, strict evidence/provenance tracking.\n- Highlighted validation pipeline: ambiguous PTM instances are a tracked error class, default exclusion from analytics, and flagged for manual review.\n\n**Scientific Critic:**  \n- Demanded operational precision: distinct nodes for all PTMs/aggregates, no inference from ambiguous PTMs to site-specific nodes, and strict analytical/QA segregation.\n- Mandated reporting of ambiguous PTMs as a KG quality metric and periodic manual audit.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendation\n\nAdopt a node-centric, ontology-mapped schema with strong granularity for PTMs and aggregate morphologies. All ambiguous/underspecified PTM mentions will be instantiated as unique, labeled nodes\u2014with provenance, strict analytic exclusion, and flagged for manual curation. All entities and relations must map to standard ontologies with unique identifiers. Evidence scoring and provenance tracking are required at the triple level, with full support for species, methodology, and source. Validation protocols must enforce precision, recall (stratified by node/edge type), and ontology compliance. This approach maximizes biological rigor, analytic precision, and future-proofing for data/model expansion.\n\n---\n\n### Answers\n\n#### 1. PROPOSE SCHEMA\n\n**Answer:**  \n**Node Types:**  \n1. Protein Isoform (site/PTM-resolved, e.g., pTau181, Tau-441)  \n2. Gene Variant (e.g., APOE*\u03b54/rs429358, TREM2-R47H/rs75932628)  \n3. Brain Region (Uberon/BRO-mapped)  \n4. Cell Type (CL-mapped, subtype-supported)  \n5. Clinical Phenotype (HPO/MONDO, diagnostic criteria-aligned)  \n6. Biomarker Measurement (LOINC/SNOMED, with units/thresholds)\n\n**Edge Types:**  \n1. phosphorylates (RO:0002419)  \n2. expressed_in (RO:0002206)  \n3. aggregates_to (GO or custom IRI, aggregate-specific)  \n4. modulates_risk_of (only with significant human evidence; MONDO/RO-mapped)  \n5. measured_in  \n6. infiltrates (RO:0002430)\n\n**Justification:**  \nEnables mechanistic, spatial, and clinical reasoning for AD; entities/edges are granular, ontology-mapped, and facilitate traceable, hypothesis-driven queries.\n\n---\n\n#### 2. DATA INGESTION\n\n**Answer:**  \n**Priority Data Sources:**  \n- ADNI (clinical, imaging, biomarker gold standard)  \n- AMP-AD Knowledge Portal (multi-omic, genetic, transcriptomic)  \n- ROSMAP (postmortem, deep phenotyping, genomics)  \n- UniProt (protein/isoform/PTM reference; PSI-MOD-mapped)\n\n**Handling Conflicting Evidence:**  \n- All edges/entities are annotated with full provenance: source, species (NCBI Taxon), evidence type (ECO), extraction confidence, and dataset version.\n- Human clinical/postmortem evidence is prioritized for risk edges; animal and preclinical evidence are retained but never merged or upscored.\n- Ambiguous/underspecified PTMs instantiated as separate \u201cgeneric PTM\u201d nodes, default-excluded from analyses and manually curated.\n\n**Justification:**  \nEnsures data completeness, species resolution, and analytic rigor; supports user filtering and downstream reproducibility.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. VALIDATION\n\n**Answer:**  \n- Gold standard: Manually curated set of 100 triples, stratified across all node/edge types, each cross-reviewed and linked to PubMed ID/dataset accession.\n- Precision: (# correct KG triples matching gold standard) / (# KG triples evaluated); target >90%.\n- Recall: (# gold standard triples present in KG) / (total # gold standard triples); stratified by node and edge type; target >60% initially.\n- Ontology Coverage: % of KG entities/relations mapped to standard ontologies; target >90%.\n\n**Justification:**  \nManual curation ensures accuracy and guards against spurious associations. Stratified KPIs surface extraction/systematic biases and enable continuous QA.\n\n---\n\n### Next Steps\n\n1. Finalize schema with explicit ontology mappings for all node/edge types, including standard IRIs/CURIEs for PTMs/aggregates.\n2. Implement extraction/ingestion pipeline with logic for PTM- and aggregate-specific node creation, provenance annotation, and ambiguous PTM handling.\n3. Build and curate the 100-triple gold standard set, stratified by node/edge type, for initial validation and extraction QA.\n4. Develop query/analytic filters to default-exclude ambiguous PTM nodes and support transparent evidence-based reasoning.\n5. Establish versioning and manual curation workflows for ambiguous PTM node resolution and audit.\n6. Track and report ambiguous PTM frequency as a KG quality metric in routine QA.\n\n---"
