        "message": "Thank you, team, for joining this critical kickoff meeting. Our objective is to define the **Technical Specification for AlzKB**, focusing on three deliverables: **Schema Core**, **Data Strategy**, and **Success Metrics**. Given the complexity of Alzheimer\u2019s Disease (AD), it\u2019s essential we are precise, especially around AD-specific features such as Tau isoforms, APOE allelic variation, and neuroimaging findings.\n\n**Initial Thoughts & Guiding Questions:**\n\n1. **Schema Core:**\n   - We must base our schema on established ontologies (e.g., SNOMED CT for clinical phenotypes, Gene Ontology for molecular entities, Neuroimaging Data Model [NIDM] for imaging features).\n   - Crucial to include entities for tau and amyloid pathology at granularity (e.g., tau isoforms, Braak stage, amyloid PET status), bridging molecular, imaging, and clinical data.\n   - Relationships should capture causal, associative, and temporal aspects (e.g., \u201chas biomarker,\u201d \u201cmeasured at timepoint,\u201d \u201cis risk factor for\u201d).\n   - Question: What minimum entity/relationship types must be present in version 1 to support advanced AD research queries?\n\n2. **Data Strategy:**\n   - High-confidence, well-curated sources only: ADNI, AMP-AD, ROSMAP, and peer-reviewed literature with structured datasets.\n   - Extraction pipelines must prioritize precision over recall\u2014better to miss an edge than to add a spurious one.\n   - Plan for a pipeline that allows reproducible extraction, entity normalization (e.g., gene/protein IDs), and cross-modal harmonization (especially for imaging-genotype links).\n   - Question: Which normalization standards and entity disambiguation protocols are most suitable for multi-modal AD datasets?\n\n3. **Success Metrics:**\n   - Must be objective, automatable, and AD-specific (e.g., coverage of known AD risk loci, number of validated tau isoform-pathology links).\n   - Graph quality (precision of entity linking, rate of false associations), query performance (latency, subgraph retrieval time), and user-facing metrics (number of unique, valid clinical-imaging-genetic triples retrieved).\n   - Question: Which 2\u20133 high-value metrics will most clearly demonstrate AlzKB\u2019s utility to the AD research community?\n\n**Request:**  \nEach member, please address these three topics\u2014**schema, data, metrics**\u2014with explicit recommendations. Highlight any technical limitations, dependencies, or standards you see as critical for a scalable, retrieval-optimized Knowledge Graph, and identify any AD-specific nuances that must not be overlooked.\n\nLet\u2019s proceed in the order: Technical Lead \u2192 Biomedical Ontologist \u2192 Data Science Lead \u2192 Scientific Critic. I look forward to your detailed, evidence-based input."

SCHEMA CORE**\n\n- **Rejection of Generic Edges:**  \n  - I strongly object to the use of imprecise, catch-all predicates such as \u201cassociated_with,\u201d \u201crelated_to,\u201d or \u201clinked_to.\u201d Every relationship class must be biologically precise and ontologically defined. Acceptable examples: \u201cphosphorylates,\u201d \u201cbinds,\u201d \u201cencodes,\u201d \u201cis_risk_allele_for,\u201d \u201cmeasured_by,\u201d \u201clocalized_in.\u201d  \n  - For clinical-imaging edges, disallow vague links like \u201chas_imaging_feature\u201d without specifying the *nature* (e.g., \u201cshows_hippocampal_atrophy_on_MRI\u201d).  \n\n- **Species Resolution:**  \n  - There is a chronic issue in AD KGs with conflating murine and human data (especially with MAPT/tau literature).  \n  - *Actionable requirement*: All entities and edges must be species-resolved at ingestion, with explicit \u201cspecies\u201d property (e.g., NCBITaxon:9606 for Homo sapiens, NCBITaxon:10090 for Mus musculus). Any inter-species extrapolation must be separately modeled, never conflated in a single node or edge.\n\n- **Entity Granularity:**  \n  - Endorse all recommendations for tau isoform and PTM granularity. However, *demand* that all \u201ctau\u201d mentions be resolved to *isoform level* (UniProt/Protein Ontology) where possible, and require explicit annotation (or \u201cambiguous\u201d flag) if primary data do not specify isoform.\n\n- **Imaging and Pathology Mapping:**  \n  - Agree with requirement for NIDM/RadLex mapping, but emphasize that *each imaging feature* must be backed by both the imaging protocol and anatomical localization (e.g., \u201creduced SUVR in left entorhinal cortex by AV-1451 PET\u201d).\n  - Pathology entities (e.g., \u201cneurofibrillary tangle\u201d) must be mapped to recognized neuropathology ontologies (e.g., MONDO, Brain Ontology). Avoid free-text \u201cpathology\u201d labels.\n\n**2. DATA STRATEGY**\n\n- **Strict Provenance Enforcement:**  \n  - No edge or node is to be loaded into AlzKB without direct, machine-resolvable provenance (PubMed ID for literature, dataset record/row for experimental data).  \n  - Extraction pipelines must *require* this linkage in order to materialize a triple.  \n  - All extracted relationships must store extraction method (pattern, ML, manual curation), confidence score, and reviewer/curator ID if applicable.\n\n- **Ambiguity Auditing:**  \n  - Entity normalization must have a fail-safe: if ambiguity cannot be resolved (e.g., \u201ctau\u201d in a paper where isoform is not clear), this must be annotated as \u201cambiguous,\u201d and these instances must not be collapsed with fully resolved entities.  \n  - Report the proportion of such \u201cambiguous\u201d cases per entity/relation type.\n\n- **Species & Ontology Error Reporting:**  \n  - All ingestion runs must provide a report of human/murine/other species ratios and flag any cases of cross-species conflation.\n  - Reject inclusion of any data extracted using \u201cAlzheimer\u2019s Disease\u201d and \u201cdementia\u201d synonymously unless the primary data specify AD diagnosis using accepted criteria (NINCDS-ADRDA, NIA-AA, etc.).\n\n**3. SUCCESS METRICS**\n\n- **Gold Standard Metrics Required:**  \n  - All quality metrics must be calculated on a *Gold Standard* subset:  \n    - Precision, Recall, F1 for entity resolution (e.g., Abeta40 vs Abeta42, tau isoforms, APOE alleles).\n    - Edge accuracy: Precision and recall against curated AD knowledge benchmarks (e.g., AlzForum mutations, GWAS Catalog, ADNI imaging\u2013genotype tables).\n    - Coverage: % of known, validated AD risk loci and tau-pathology associations recovered.\n  - *Reject* subjective or qualitative metrics (\u201cresearcher utility,\u201d \u201ccompleteness reporting\u201d) unless supported by quantitative analysis of query logs or gold standard recall.\n\n- **Ambiguity Tracking:**  \n  - Proportion of ambiguous vs. resolved entities/edges must be reported for every knowledge graph release.\n\n- **Provenance Completeness:**  \n  - Every triple must be traceable to its original source; aim for 100%\u2014any entity/edge lacking provenance is grounds for exclusion.\n\n**Critical Risks & Non-Negotiables:**\n\n- No \u201cshortcut\u201d mapping of tau/PTMs, or AD/dementia, or human/mouse.  \n- No edge or node without machine-resolvable provenance.  \n- Mandatory gold standard evaluation for entity disambiguation and edge types, before and after each major KG release.\n\n**Summary:**  \nAlzKB\u2019s credibility depends on biological specificity, rigorous provenance, and quantitative, Gold Standard-based evaluation. Any methodological compromise (vague predicates, unresolved species or isoforms, missing provenance) will undermine both downstream analytics and trust. No edge/entity should be loaded without passing these standards."

For V1, only precise, ontology-backed relationships will be implemented. \u201cLinked_to\u201d and similar catch-alls are disallowed.\n\n**b) Species Resolution:**\n- **Conflict:** Only the Scientific Critic explicitly requires species annotation and the rejection of inter-species conflation.\n- **Resolution:** Literature in AD is replete with human/mouse conflation (MAPT, tau). Including a \u201cspecies\u201d attribute, as per NCBITaxon, is necessary to ensure biological fidelity and support translational research. Adopt this requirement.\n\n**c) Ambiguity Handling:**\n- **Conflict:** Degree of tolerance for ambiguous entities/edges.\n- **Resolution:** All agree ambiguity must be flagged and tracked; inclusion in KG is allowed only if explicitly labeled as \u201cambiguous\u201d and never merged with resolved entities.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Agenda Status**\n\n**All agenda items are advancing.**  \n- **Schema Core:** Strong consensus with actionable requirements and AD-specific nuance.  \n- **Data Strategy:** Agreement on data source quality, normalization rigor, and provenance.  \n- **Success Metrics:** High bar for quantitative, gold-standard-based metrics; ambiguity and provenance completeness must be explicitly reported.\n\nPending only on finalized protocols for ambiguous/underspecified edges/entities and implementation detail for cross-species modeling.\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Clarifying Question**\n\n**To All (esp.

Opportunity: Supports meta-analyses on \u201cknown unknowns,\u201d trending ambiguity over time, and may prompt curation prioritization.\n    - **Maintenance:** Added complexity in schema and query logic; ambiguous entities must be strictly isolated from resolved instances (no merging).\n  - **Recommendation:** Support inclusion of ambiguous tau/PTM mentions as flagged entities, provided (a) they are never merged with resolved forms, (b) downstream users are warned about their ambiguous status, and (c) ambiguity is quantified in all analytics/exports. This balances coverage with transparency.\n\n**Other Inputs on Synthesis Points:**\n\n- **Species Resolution:** Fully support mandatory species tagging on all biological entities and relationships, as proposed by the Scientific Critic. This is straightforward to enforce programmatically and ensures no future human/mouse conflation.\n- **No Catch-all Edges:** Will revise schema to eliminate all generic predicates (\u201clinked_to,\u201d etc.), using only precise, ontology-backed relations. This adds implementation overhead in schema mapping but is justified by improved data fidelity.\n- **Ambiguity Tracking:** Will implement dashboard/reporting to monitor ambiguous vs. resolved entity/edge proportions per release.\n\n**Dependencies/Operational Notes:**\n- Ambiguity and species attributes should be part of the core node/edge schema from the outset for consistency.\n- Will require additional ETL pipeline logic for ambiguous entity flagging and for enforcing no merging between ambiguous/resolved nodes.\n\n**Summary:**  \n- Technically, it is practical to include ambiguous tau/PTM entities in V1 if (and only if) they are unequivocally flagged and isolated, with their ambiguity exposed to all downstream users.\n- Fully align with team consensus on species annotation, provenance rigor, and elimination of generic edge types.  \n- Prepared to deliver schema and ETL pipeline updates per these refined requirements."

If the ambiguity is greater than what the ontology provides, annotate with `skos:note` or a similar property describing the ambiguity.\n  - *Inclusion vs. Exclusion:*  \n    - **Inclusion (with explicit ambiguity):**  \n      - *Coverage:* Accurately reflects the state of the knowledge, especially in legacy or low-detail literature.  \n      - *Interoperability:* Maintains semantic transparency and prevents category errors.  \n      - *Curation:* Enables downstream prioritization for manual review and future disambiguation.\n    - **Exclusion:**  \n      - *Coverage loss:* Risks omitting a significant body of evidence, underrepresenting literature where isoforms/sites are not resolved.\n      - *Downstream analytics:* May bias network analyses or meta-research, especially in systematic reviews.\n  - *Recommendation:* **Inclusion is preferable,** strictly conditional on (a) unambiguous \u201cambiguous\u201d flagging, (b) logical separation from resolved entities, and (c) full provenance annotation and reporting. This is in keeping with OBO Foundry/FAIR best practices.\n\n**Other Inputs on Synthesis Points:**\n\n- **Species Resolution:**  \n  - Strongly support. All biological entities and relationships must have a `species` or `in_taxon` property (use NCBITaxon identifiers). For ambiguous species (e.g., in vitro or unspecified), use a defined \u201cunknown taxon\u201d code and document rationale.\n- **Precision of Relations:**  \n  - Reiterate: Only use relationships defined in canonical ontologies (RO, OBO Relations Ontology, etc.). If no suitable predicate exists, propose a new term through OBO channels and document the temporary mapping.\n- **Ambiguity Tracking and Reporting:**  \n  - All ambiguous entities and edges must be quantified, annotated with reason/source, and included in KG release notes and analytics.\n\n**Operational/Schema Recommendations:**\n- Schema must support:  \n  - `has_ambiguity` flag (boolean) and free-text `ambiguity_note`.\n  - Separate class/label for ambiguous vs. resolved forms.\n  - Provenance and ambiguity status as mandatory properties on all tau/PTM and related nodes.\n- All scripts for KG use/export should warn users by default when ambiguous nodes are included in outputs.\n\n**Summary:**  \n- Inclusion of ambiguous tau/PTM entities is ontologically correct and maximizes transparency, provided all ambiguity is captured, flagged, and tracked.\n- Full agreement with team on precise predicates, species annotation, and provenance/ambiguity reporting.

        "message": "### Agenda\n\n**Restated:**  \nOur task was to define the detailed technical specification for AlzKB, a retrieval-optimized, scalable Knowledge Graph for Alzheimer\u2019s Disease research. The specification must address:  \n1. The **Schema Core**, including rigorous adherence to biomedical ontologies and AD-specific nuances (notably tau isoform/PTM granularity and species annotation).  \n2. The **Data Strategy**, covering data source selection, entity normalization, multi-modal integration, provenance, and handling of ambiguous/underspecified information.\n3. The **Success Metrics**, emphasizing precision, coverage of AD-relevant entities/relations, gold-standard benchmarking, and explicit ambiguity/provenance tracking.  \nAll decisions must be specific, operationalizable, and designed for high trust and interoperability in the AD research community.\n\n---\n\n### Team Member Input\n\n#### **Technical Lead (Knowledge Graph Engineering)**\n- Advocated for an OWL/property-graph hybrid, with all schema elements mapped to standard ontologies (HGNC, UniProt, SNOMED CT, MONDO, NIDM).\n- Insisted on tau isoforms and PTMs as entities, APOE alleles as explicit genotypes, and fine-grained relationships, including \u201cmeasured at timepoint\u201d.\n- Agreed to eliminate generic predicates in favor of ontologically precise relationships.\n- Supported inclusion of ambiguous tau/PTM mentions as flagged, separate entities, provided they are never merged with resolved forms and ambiguity is visible downstream.\n- Agreed on mandatory species annotation (NCBITaxon) for all biological entities.\n\n#### **Biomedical Ontologist (AlzKB Semantics & Standards)**\n- Emphasized strict mapping of all entities and relationships to established ontologies (OBO Foundry, SNOMED CT, UMLS, Protein Ontology, NIDM, HPO).\n- Recommended explicit \u201chas_ambiguity\u201d property and ontological documentation for ambiguous tau/PTM mentions.\n- Asserted that semantic transparency and ontological rigor (including synonym handling and logical separation of ambiguous entities) take precedence over raw coverage.\n- Supported species annotation and the reporting of all ambiguous cases.\n\n#### **Data Science Lead (Extraction & Validation)**\n- Stressed that a high percentage of tau/PTM references in literature are ambiguous, but that excluding them would significantly impair knowledge graph coverage.\n- Argued for the inclusion of ambiguous mentions as distinctly flagged, provenance-rich nodes, never merged with resolved forms.\n- Agreed to enforce precision > recall, full provenance, and ambiguity/error tracking at all stages.\n- Will implement extraction, entity normalization, and curation protocols to operationalize these requirements.\n\n#### **Scientific Critic (AlzKB)**\n- Rejected generic relationship types and demanded biologically precise, ontology-backed predicates.\n- Insisted on species resolution (NCBITaxon), strict provenance, and logical separation of ambiguous entities/edges.\n- Stated that ambiguity rates must be reported as a standard graph health metric and that query/API defaults should **exclude** ambiguous entities unless users opt in.\n- Stressed that ambiguous nodes should never contaminate downstream analytics and must be quantified and flagged in all exports and reports.\n\n---\n\n### Recommendation\n\n**Based on the synthesis of all inputs and expert judgment:**\n\n#### **Schema Core**\n- **Adopt an OWL/property-graph hybrid model**, mapped rigorously to SNOMED CT, OBO ontologies, and domain standards.\n- **Explicitly represent tau isoforms and PTMs at the highest resolvable granularity** (using UniProt/Protein Ontology IDs, PTM sites with PSI-MOD), and always annotate with species (NCBITaxon).  \n- **All predicates must be ontology-backed and biologically/clinically specific** (e.g., \u201cencodes\u201d, \u201chas_phosphorylation_at\u201d, \u201cis_risk_allele_for\u201d, \u201cmeasured_by\u201d).\n- **Ambiguous entities (tau/PTMs, species, pathology, etc.) are to be included only as strictly flagged, logically isolated nodes/edges**, never merged with resolved items. Each ambiguous item must have a `has_ambiguity` property and be annotated with detailed provenance.\n\n#### **Data Strategy**\n- **Include only high-confidence, provenance-rich datasets** (ADNI, ROSMAP, AMP-AD, etc.) for V1.  \n- **All extracted data must be normalized to gold-standard identifiers** (CURIEs), with robust cross-ontology mapping and synonym handling.\n- **Ambiguous mentions** (tau/PTM, species, etc.) must be algorithmically and curator-flagged, with complete provenance (including extraction context), and isolated in both storage and query layers.\n- **Species must be annotated on every biological node/edge**, and cross-species conflation is strictly prohibited.\n- **Provenance is mandatory** for every entity and relationship; items lacking provenance are excluded.\n\n#### **Success Metrics**\n- **Extraction/annotation precision targets:** >98% for molecular, >95% for clinical/imaging entities, <2% FPR for tau isoform\u2013pathology\u2013region links (benchmarked on gold standards).\n- **Coverage:** Percent of known AD risk loci, APOE alleles, tau isoform/pathology relationships, and imaging features mapped to ontologies.\n- **Ambiguity reporting:** Number/proportion of ambiguous vs. resolved entities/edges is to be reported in every release.\n- **Provenance completeness:** 100% of nodes/edges must have machine-resolvable provenance.\n- **Default query/API behavior:** Exclude ambiguous nodes/edges unless user explicitly opts in; all exports must include ambiguity and provenance metrics.\n\n**Justification:**  \nThis approach ensures maximal biological fidelity, semantic transparency, and community trust. It supports both high-precision knowledge retrieval and meta-research into the structure of AD knowledge itself, while providing a path for future curation and automated disambiguation as data and methods improve.\n\n---\n\n### Next Steps\n\n1. **Schema Finalization:**  \n   - Technical Lead and Biomedical Ontologist to draft and circulate the first version of the schema, including explicit support for ambiguity, species, and provenance attributes.\n   - All relationship types and entity classes to be mapped to canonical ontologies; ambiguous forms to be included as outlined.\n\n2. **Pipeline Updates:**  \n   - Data Science Lead to update extraction and normalization pipelines to tag ambiguous entities/edges, enforce species annotation, and block merging of ambiguous/resolved nodes.\n   - Scientific Critic to review and stress test the pipeline for leakage of ambiguous information and species misannotation.\n\n3. **Validation and Reporting:**  \n   - Implement dashboards/reports for ambiguity rates, precision metrics, and provenance completeness.\n   - Release documentation templates to include ambiguity metrics and guidance for downstream users on filtering/handling ambiguous knowledge.\n\n4. **Gold Standard Benchmarking:**  \n   - Assemble gold standard entity and relation sets (tau isoforms, APOE alleles, key AD loci, clinical-imaging-genetic triples) for initial precision and coverage evaluation.\n\n5. **User-facing Defaults:**  \n   - Ensure query interfaces and exports default to excluding ambiguous knowledge, with clear user warnings/documentation.\n\n6. **Review and Iteration:**  \n   - Schedule follow-up review after first pipeline run and schema implementation to assess ambiguity handling, precision, and user acceptability.\n\n---\n\n*This concludes the technical specification phase for AlzKB. The team is aligned on a schema and strategy that is both AD-specific and broadly interoperable. Implementation and validation will proceed per this recommendation, with transparency and rigorous reporting as ongoing requirements.*"
